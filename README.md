## Multi-disciplinary Product Designer & Design Engineer

### I work across strategy, research, UX, UI, accessibility, usability, interaction and visual design, brand systems, and front-end engineering—designing and building complex systems that turn complexity into clarity.

I specialise in:

🧪 User-centred research, usability & accessibility  
📊 Data-rich workflows & high-performance interfaces  
🎨 Design craft across UX, UI, interaction & visual design  
🧩 Systems thinking & scalable design systems  
🛠️ Performance-minded front-end engineering  


My experience spans fintech, financial compliance, banking, insurance, healthcare, global health, NGOs, nonprofits, humanitarian organisations, e-commerce, customer & digital experience, network management, telecom, logistics, shipping, property management, sports, creative campaigns, and multilingual/multi-regional international platforms.

I’ve delivered products end-to-end—from early discovery and 0→1 initiatives to mature enterprise-scale systems—and I’m fluent across 0→1 (new products), 1→n (scale), and −1→+1 (re-architecture), operating as both an IC and a design leader in startups, scaleups, enterprise, and SaaS environments.

I’ve worked across startups, scaleups, enterprise and SaaS organisations in both agency and in-house environments—operating as a team of one as well as leading large cross-functional design and product teams.

I bring a blend of **systems thinking**, **design craft**, **user-centred research**, and **engineering-focused delivery**.
